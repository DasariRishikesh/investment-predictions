# investment-predictions

## Project Description
Investment Predictions is a project aimed at using machine learning techniques to predict stock market changes. The stock market is known for its volatility, and traditional investment models often fall short in capturing these rapid changes. By leveraging machine learning models, this project seeks to automate the investment prediction process and provide more accurate forecasts.

## Technologies
- **Machine Learning**
- **Python**

## Domain
- **Finance**

## Problem Statement
The stock market is characterized by its frequent ups and downs, which can change in no time. Traditional investment models often struggle to keep up with these rapid changes. By using machine learning models, we aim to identify market changes earlier and more accurately, thereby automating the investment prediction process.

## Dataset
(Need to do R&D for the source)

## Initial Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- Virtual Environment (venv)

### Repository Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/investment-predictions.git
    cd investment-predictions
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv env
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
